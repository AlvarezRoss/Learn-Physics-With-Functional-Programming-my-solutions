# Learn-Physics-With-Functional-Programming-my-solutions
My solutions to Scott N.Walck's book Lean Physics with Functional Programming publish by No Starch Press

In this repository, I will upload the solutions, one chapter at a time, as I complete them.
Please note that the solutions may be incorrect, as I am not an expert and new to Haskell.
